#Social Netwrok Analysis: An online Interactive Tool 
##A tool to help students to understand communication network concepts (e.g., betweenness, closeness centrality, degree, frequency) based on simulated network data.
The tool also allows student to build their own communication network using the same tool and then are asked to explain the network they have created in the class.
The tool can be accessed [HERE](https://aalbusaidi.shinyapps.io/interactiveLearning/)

When opening a site click on the left menu on SNA>Frequency; SNA> Direction; SNA> Degree; SNA > Create (this is dynamic interactive learning where students can add/delete nodes & edges). They are asked to create egocentric network of 5 alters for example, the tool helps them to apply and understand the nature of network concepts using this only interactive tool.
